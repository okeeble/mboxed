## mboxed

One-click installation of ScienceBox on a single host, based on minikube.


### Quick Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Run (as sudo)
  ```
  SetupInstall.sh
  ScienceBox.sh
  ```
3. Open a browser and go to https://<your_host>


### Limitations and known issues
- A valid TLS certificate must be provided to the nginx ingress controller (upstream documentation at https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/)
  - If no valid TLS certificate is provided, SWAN's jupyterhub will refuse to start and integration with EOS storage will not be possible.
  - A workaround to tolerate self-signed certificates (or default nginx ingress certificate) is being worked on.
- Storage persistency is not provided in minikube at the moment. Data stored in ScienceBox will be lost when containers are removed // restarted.
- Software packages required by SWAN are fetched on demand via CVMFS. In case of slow Internet connection, starting a SWAN session may timeout and fail. Retrying immediately after helps in spawning the session successfully.

Since Minikube is configured to run with the `none` driver, one needs to have the root privileges to access the services deployed as a part of ScienceBox. More information about the `none` driver can be found [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/none/).

Since, we need to root privilege to run ScienceBox, the user might run into following error when running `sudo ./ScienceBox.sh` or `sudo ./ScienceBox_Delete.sh`:

```
‚ùå  Exiting due to HOST_JUJU_LOCK_PERMISSION: writing kubeconfig: Error writing file /root/.kube/config: failed to acquire lock for /root/.kube/config: {Name:mk72a1487fd2da23da9e8181e16f352a6105bd56 Clock:{} Delay:500ms Timeout:1m0s Cancel:<nil>}: unable to open /tmp/juju-mk72a1487fd2da23da9e8181e16f352a6105bd56: permission denied
```

In order to fix the above issue, user can run `sudo sysctl fs.protected_regular=0`.
